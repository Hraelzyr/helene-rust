Roguelike.  
**Spoilers follow ahead!!**

The World is finite and self-looping. 
The Otherworld is where people go when they die, where they are reborn. 
Magic is the harnessing of the laws of the Otherworld to subvert the laws of this world. 
The World Between Worlds(the Between) is where souls pass through between one world and the other.

### Mechanics
No mana, instead preservation of reality: 
greater anomalies as you cast more. It's a function of all reality

Decided to keep HP.

Resistances are i16s. Normalised 0-100 when displayed.

### Factions
1. **The Hidden Ones**: <p> Led by Sussurus, He Who Does Not Obtrude. The Lodge's members work in the shadows, acquiring others' items and inhuming targets for pay. 
They have a strict code of behaviour whose breakage can lead to penance or excommunication.</p>
2. **The Learners**: <p> Led by Amathis, the Unknowing One. The Association's members further the understanding of the worlds and their interaction. 
Their code of ethics is rigorously enforced and disciplinary committees may expel unethical researchers.</p>
3. **The Church of Purity**: <p> Led by Maximus, the One True God. The Church's members eliminate all heathens and their shrines. 
Failure to spread the word of Hyperion by any and all means possible is grounds for suspension and even laicization. </p>
4. **The House of Wood**: <p> Led by Nibor, the Exchequer. The Bank's members work toward the accrual of gold. Ranking in the Cult is based on the amount of wealth an acolyte possesses and (unsure) {their rate of interest on it}. </p>
5. **The Red Banner**: <p> Led by Morkom, the Lord of Honor. The Regiment's members take contracts to eliminate targets and participate in wars, or simply kill powerful beasts for honor. Inactivity may lead to a dishonourable discharge. </p>
6. **The Death Dealers**: <p> Led by Adrestia, the Destroyer. The College's members are expected to regularly (use their spells to) destroy things. Inactivity may lead to expulsion.</p>
7. **The Timekeepers**: <p> Some sort of Chei for a god, maybe time travel. </p> 
8. **The Lady**: <p>She has no cult in her name, just random altars. Those who pray to her are not guaranteed anything except her attention.</p>
